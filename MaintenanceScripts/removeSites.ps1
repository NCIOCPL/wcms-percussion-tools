<#
	Removes web sites from IIS and optionally deletes the site's physical folder code,
	associated AppPool and additional content directories.

	Site Removal

		Every site to be removed receives an entry in the <SiteList> structure.
		Set the attribute values as follows:
		
		name (required) - Contains the site's name from IIS configuration. (Not the host name.)
						  The sitelist powershell script can provide a list of valid site name's.

	    removeFiles (optional) - Controls deletion of the site's physical folder.  Set to one (1)
								to delete.
								
		removeAppPool (optional) - Controls deletion of the site's AppPool.  Set to one (1)
								to delete.


	Removing Additonal Directories

		Directories outside a site's direct file tree (e.g. the "PublishedContent" folder
		associated with a WCMS site) may be deleted by listing them as entries in the
		<DirectoryList> structure.
